## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### **Agent System**
- **6 Specialized Agents**: Ruby (Concierge), Dr. Warren (Medical), Advik (Performance), Carla (Nutrition), Rachel (Physio), Neel (Lead)
- **SLA Tracking**: Each agent has response time targets and escalation rules
- **Urgency Detection**: Automatic classification of message urgency (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Smart Routing**: LLM-based routing to appropriate agents based on message content

### **Episode Management**
Episodes structure all member interactions with:
- **Triggers**: member_initiated | system_alert | scheduled_checkup
- **State Tracking**: member emotional/engagement state before/after
- **Interventions**: Actions taken by agents with outcomes
- **Friction Analysis**: Categorized pain points and resolutions

### **Decision Provenance (Why-Traceability)**
Every decision links to:
- **Evidence**: Biomarker data, CGM curves, conversation summaries
- **Source Messages**: Specific chat references with timestamps
- **Rationale**: Agent reasoning for the decision
- **Timeline**: When and why the decision was made

### **Experiment Engine**
Transform suggestions into structured experiments:
- **5 Templates**: Sleep optimization, nutrition trials, supplement tests, exercise protocols, CGM meal tests
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Clear success criteria and measurement protocols
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time measurement collection and analysis
- **Results Analysis**: Automatic success/failure determination
