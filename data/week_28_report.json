I can set up a countdown calendar, suggest a packing list tailored to your itinerary, and provide a local map with metro schedules so you can navigate smoothly. If you need a quick review of your agenda or want me to arrange a last‑minute meeting room, just let me know. I’ll keep everything in sync and send you a pre‑departure checklist by the end of the week. Safe travels!",
