If you’d like, I can schedule a quick check‑in next week to see how the updated exercise plan is fitting with your meals and to tweak anything that’s not working. Let me know a convenient time, or if you’d prefer I’ll set a reminder for you. Also, I can pull up your nutrition log to make sure the macros align with your workout goals—just say the word. Looking forward to hearing how it goes!",
