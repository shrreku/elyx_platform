Here’s a quick checklist to keep everything smooth:  \n\n1. **Travel Documents** – Confirm passport, visa, and any required health certificates are up‑to‑date.  \n2. **Itinerary & Schedule** – Upload your flight, hotel, and meeting details to your calendar (I’ll sync it for you).  \n3. **Packing** – Pack essentials (power adapters, work attire, travel‑size toiletries) and leave a small “just in case” bag.  \n4. **Local Logistics** – I’ve arranged a pre‑arrival airport transfer and a local SIM for instant connectivity.  \n5. **Health & Safety** – Book any needed insurance and check local travel advisories.  \n6. **Reminder** – I’ll send a reminder 48 hrs before departure with all key details.  \n\nLet me know if you’d like any additional support—happy travels!",
