      "Message": "Great to hear you felt stable and your HR zones were on target today! Your recent blood test flagged elevated fasting glucose, so let’s treat that as a hypothesis that dietary carbs may be influencing your recovery and training readiness.  \n\n**Next steps:**\n1. **Nutrition:** Log all meals and note glycemic index; aim for a lower‑GI spread (e.g., whole grains, legumes, veggies).  \n2. **Training:** Keep the intensity similar but add a light recovery session (e.g., 20‑30 min brisk walk) to monitor HRV response.  \n3. **Recovery:** Prioritize 7–8 h sleep, hydrate, and consider a post‑exercise cool‑down stretch to support HRV.  \n\nTrack HRV and glucose‑related symptoms for the next week; we’ll adjust the plan based on what the data shows. Keep up the good work!",

Feeling dizzy after ~30 min can be a sign of low blood sugar or dehydration, especially with a recent high‑sugar reading. Here’s a quick action plan:\n\n1. **Check your glucose** right before you start and again at 25–30 min. Aim for 100–140 mg/dL.  \n2. **Hydrate** with water or an electrolyte drink; a 12‑oz cup every 10–15 min can help.  \n3. **Adjust intensity**: drop to a 1‑2 % lower heart‑rate target or shorten the session until you feel steadier.  \n4. **Snack**: a small carb (e.g., a banana or ½ cup of juice) after a 30‑min break can stabilize levels.  \n5. **Listen to your body**: if dizziness persists, pause exercise and rest in a cool spot.  \n\nIf these tweaks don’t help or you notice frequent lows/hits, let’s schedule a quick check‑in with your healthcare provider. You’ve got this—stay safe and keep up the great work!",

      "Message": "Great job noting the spike! A peak of 110 mg/dL is still within normal limits, but if it feels uncomfortable or you’re aiming for tighter control, a few tweaks can help.  \n\n**Breakfast composition:**  \n- Swap high‑glycemic carbs (white toast, sugary cereal) for lower‑GI foods—steel‑cut oats, whole‑grain toast, or a small bowl of berries.  \n- Add protein or healthy fat (Greek yogurt, a boiled egg, a spoonful of nut butter) to slow digestion.  \n- Include a fiber source (chia seeds, flaxseed, or a handful of nuts).  \n\n**Exercise timing:**  \nYour updated exercise plan is a great tool. A short 10–15‑minute brisk walk or light cardio right after breakfast can blunt the spike by increasing glucose uptake.  \n\n**Behavioral cue:** Pair your breakfast with a routine—e.g., “coffee + walk” or “lunch + stretch”—to make the change automatic.  \n\nTrack the next few days’ CGM; we’ll adjust if the pattern persists. You’re on the right track!",

      "Message": "Hi! A 137‑mg/dL spike after breakfast is a moderate rise—good news that your glucose is still within a healthy range, but it’s a cue to tweak the meal a bit.  \n**Why it happened:**  \n– High‑glycemic carbs (e.g., white toast, sugary cereal) raise blood sugar quickly.  \n– Limited protein, fiber, and healthy fats slow absorption, giving a steadier rise.  \n\n**What to try next week (with your new exercise plan):**  \n1. **Swap carbs for lower‑GI options**: oatmeal, whole‑grain toast, or a small fruit portion.  \n2. **Add protein**: Greek yogurt, a boiled egg, or a scoop of plant‑based protein powder.  \n3. **Include healthy fat**: a tablespoon of nut butter, avocado, or a handful of nuts.  \n4. **Pair with a brisk 10‑min walk** soon after eating—this boosts insulin sensitivity and can blunt the peak.  \n\n**Supplement note:** A 200‑mg magnesium supplement can help moderate glucose spikes, especially if you’re training hard.  \n\nKeep tracking; we’ll adjust as we see how these changes affect your CGM trends. Great progress—keep it up!",
