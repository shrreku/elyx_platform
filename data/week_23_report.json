When you’re ready to dive in, just drop me a quick note with the dates or tasks you’re tackling. I can slot them into your calendar, set reminders, or flag any potential roadblocks so you stay on track. If you’d like, I can also arrange a brief mid‑week check‑in to review progress and tweak plans as needed. Feel free to reach out anytime; I’m here to keep the friction out of your week. Looking forward to hearing how it goes!",
