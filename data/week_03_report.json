I can also double‑check your travel documents, flight times, and any pre‑flight requirements (like passport, visa, or health certificates). If you’d like, I’ll set a calendar reminder for your packing milestones—e.g., “Pack luggage” 3 days out, “Print boarding pass” 1 day out. Just ping me if there’s anything else you’d like to prep.
