When you’re ready, let me set up a countdown calendar and gentle reminders for key tasks—visa checks, luggage list, flight confirmations, and any local appointments. I can also suggest a packing checklist tailored to your destination, and set a virtual check‑in a day before departure to review everything. If you’d like, I can automate a daily prompt to confirm you’re on track. Just let me know any specific preferences, and I’ll integrate them right away. Safe travels!",
