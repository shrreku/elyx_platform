# 8-Month Chat Simulation — Full Conversation Journey

This document contains the entire chat simulation mapped across an 8-month, month-wise journey. Each entry includes date, time, sender, and the message content. Decision points (where a reply / choice is expected) are flagged and mapped to the visualizer input file at `data/conversation_history_for_visualizer.json`.

Simulation start: 2024-12-18  
Simulation end: 2025-07-18

## How this maps to the Decision Tree Visualizer

- A connector script `simulation/connector_to_visualizer.py` produces `data/conversation_history_for_visualizer.json`. That file contains enriched fields expected by the visualizer (`S.No.`, `Sender`, `Message`, `Day`, `Date`, `Time`, `Reply_Needed`, `Recommendations`).
- Decision points are flagged when a message is a question (contains '?') or contains actionable recommendations from an agent.
- The visualizer reads `data/conversation_history_for_visualizer.json` via `simulation/decision_tree_visualizer.py` and will analyze branching paths, recommendations, and build a one-way graph representing user choices and workflow.

## Files generated / used

- docs/conversation_journey.md (this file)
- simulation/connector_to_visualizer.py (script that creates the visualizer input)
- data/conversation_history_for_visualizer.json (auto-generated by the connector)
- simulation/decision_tree_visualizer.py (existing visualizer — consumes the generated JSON)

## Usage

1. Run the connector to generate visualizer input:
   - python3 simulation/connector_to_visualizer.py
   - This will write `data/conversation_history_for_visualizer.json` and print the output path.

2. Run the visualizer analysis (will load the generated file):
   - python3 simulation/decision_tree_visualizer.py

3. The visualizer will produce a text report and can be extended to serve the graph in the UI at `ui/decision_tree_visualizer.html` or via `ui/serve_decision_tree.py`.
